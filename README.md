# Electricity-Consumption-Calculator-
This project involves creating a utility program in Python or C++ to calculate and display electricity consumption costs based on predefined slabs. The program uses a two-dimensional array for source data, with functions `costSlab1()`, `costSlab2()`, and `costSlab3()` calculating costs for specific slabs. The user interacts via a menu, entering a student ID and choosing options like displaying costs for slab 1, slab 2, or slab 3. The program runs until the user decides to exit. It provides a concise and user-friendly way to manage electricity costs.
